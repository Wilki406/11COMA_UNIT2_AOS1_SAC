# 11COMA_UNIT2_AOS1_SAC

Overview of Task:

Groups of 2-4 students will collaborate to document the planning, analysis, design, development and evaluation of their chosen innovative digital solution.

They will also present their innovative solution in the form of a class presentation, video or poster. 

This task covers the key knowledge and skill for Unit 2.1 which are displayed on the Innovative Solutions course page on Crest.

Examples:

Each group must develop a solution to a different identified need.

Two examples of needs are:

1. Internet of Things: The home refrigerator (or the school Food Technology refrigerator) is fitted with bar code scanners and RFID readers. These identify what is removed from the fridge and what is put in to the fridge.  This could be further extended to having a built in weighing device that can measure how much is put in to the fridge. E.g. The amount of milk left in the container or ice cream in the ice cream container. Then the fridge would be able to wirelessly send a list of shortages to the person who does the shopping. This could be extended (at school) by using an RFID scanner or NFC to show which student removes items.

2. Other innovative digital solution: In many schools there are issues with accurate roll marking. A possible solution is to embed RFID chips in Student ID cards that are scanned on entry to classrooms. Alternatively using NFC with a student phone to perform the same task. Further exploration could be done with the 2020 scenario of remote learning and scanning for the roll.

Next Steps:

1) Read and download task guide and documentation template

2) Find your groups on teams and start planning collaboration strategies (what software will you use to collaborate on top of teams?)

3) Brainstorm digital solutions and identify some needs to focus on.
